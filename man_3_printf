PRINTF
Descrption

the function that we develop allows the analysis of a chain that is 
analyzed that is parsed term by term and that depending on the 
special characters found returns the string in a stipulated format.

In the following table the characters used for the string analysis
are mentioned

    Symbols                 format

        %c          print a character
        %d          print a decimal number (base10)
        %in         print an integer (base10)
        %s          print a string
        %%          print a percentage

In the this document will be mentioned examples and interactions of
how the algorithm behaves in the cases already mentioned.
The objective of this document is to be an interactive tool that will 
allow the user to understand the algorithm that was used and how the
program is going to be will be executed under normal conditions.

example 1

we have the string "hello" which is in the main, this string is our 
case study to understand the development of the program, this string
in the format function this function is called in the printf.

        int _printf(const char *format, ...)

The program is called and is told that a list of arguments will be
used with the command va_list and that a list_argument variable will
be used, which is a data type, then list_argument is initialized, 
which is the one in charge of calling format.

        va_start(list_argument, format);

then a format check is performed by means of an if which is intended 
to discard if format is false or in position [0] there is a "%" and 
in position [1] there is a "%". discard if format is false or in 
position [0] there is a "%" and in position [1] it is "\0" return 
"-1". is "\0" return "-1".

        if (!format || (format[0] == '%' && format[1] == '\0'))
                        return (-1);

performs a string analysis and enters the first if which evaluates 
if format is false or format at position 0 is equal to % and format 
at position 1 is equal to null.
