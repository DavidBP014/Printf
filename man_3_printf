PRINTF
Descrption

the function that we develop allows the analysis of a chain that is 
analyzed that is parsed term by term and that depending on the 
special characters found returns the string in a stipulated format.

In the following table the characters used for the string analysis
are mentioned

    Symbols                 format

        %c          print a character
        %d          print a decimal number (base10)
        %in         print an integer (base10)
        %s          print a string
        %%          print a percentage

In the this document will be mentioned examples and interactions of
how the algorithm behaves in the cases already mentioned.
The objective of this document is to be an interactive tool that will 
allow the user to understand the algorithm that was used and how the 
program is going to be will be executed under normal conditions.

example 1

we have the string "hello" which is in the main, This string is
composed of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it 
appears.

        int _printf(const char *format, ...)
